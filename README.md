# AirlineSatisfactionML

## Overview
This project uses machine learning to analyze airline passenger satisfaction. It identifies key factors that influence customer experience and predicts satisfaction based on travel class, inflight services, and boarding efficiency.

## Dataset
The dataset comes from Kaggle:  
[Airline Passenger Satisfaction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/teejmahal20/airline-passenger-satisfaction)

It contains passenger survey responses on their flight experience and satisfaction ratings.

## Repository Contents
- **Raw Data**: Original dataset files from Kaggle.
- **Cleaned Data**: Processed data for analysis.
- **Tableau Data**: Formatted for visualizations.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Includes EDA and machine learning models.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualizations reveal trends in customer satisfaction. Key insights are shared in an interactive dashboard:
